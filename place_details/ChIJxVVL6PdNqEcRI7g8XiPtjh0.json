To start with they were quite welcoming. The waiter took our drinks orders and managed to mess that up which wasn\u2019t a good start. We then ordered our meals and he read them back to us and we confirmed them. As a table of 5 it was that difficult to get the order right. Mine and my kids meals arrived about 15 minutes after ordering them. They put salad bowls on our table but no bread rolls like all the rest of the people eating at tables near us. My wife and brother in laws meals arrived about 15 minutes after ours and the order was wrong. The waiter didn\u2019t look overly impressed when we told him the order was wrong and begrudgingly took the plates away. After a further 10 minutes the correct order came with no apology, by this time myself and the kids had finished ours. When we completed our meals we decided not to bother with desserts as we had already been in there way too long. We asked for the bill 2 or 3 times and it took them ages to bring it over. When we finally got it the bill had the wrong meals on it so he had to amend it. We paid the bill but as we had no apology for the errors we did not tip them as the service was so bad. I would never recommend this place to anyone as the attitude of the waiter who served us was extremely poor.
