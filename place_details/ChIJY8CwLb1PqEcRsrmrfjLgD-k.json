She came back and forgot my order so I told her about that and she informed me that now I have to wait 10 min like it was my fault! Absolute nightmare! In the end we were happy to have food which was amazing! The cook came out and we gave him thumbs up! The pizzas we ordered were really tasty! We asked for the bill and even though the restaurant was practically empty ,it took the waitress a while to come back. She gave us the bill and we gave her the money waiting for her to give us the change back as we did not want to leave her any tip money ,she took all and left!!!
