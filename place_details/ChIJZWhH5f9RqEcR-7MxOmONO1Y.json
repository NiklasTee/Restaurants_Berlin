experience at Gloria.\nI was unlucky on my first time at this restaurant.\n\nTwo stars because the staff at least were kind.\n\nI had to wait almost 30 minutes in line to order.\nThe reason was that some items on the menu were sold out, but the cashier had to explain it by voice to every customer instead of making it clear for customers on the menu.\n\nI had myself to suggest getting one of the paper menus and suggest them to cross the items that were missing.\n\nAfter this unpleasant and unnecessary wait, I waited for more than one hour to have my food served, which had to be changed because those were not what I and my friends have ordered.\n\nAlso, it's not fair to see that other people that got to the place after then us, have had their orders delivered. Some of there were delivery service that arrived much after then my order time and, although waited for a long time, had their orders delivered before then mine.\n\nWhen we finally got the food, the taste was flat, burned outside and cold inside. It seems people increased the oven temperature to make it faster or that things were frozen. I don't know.\n\nThe empanadas were dry, burned outside, and cold inside. Tasteless.\n\nDefinitely, you guys need to improve your attention to demand and reduce the unnecessary waiting time.\n\nI will get it a try another time and I hope to come to google maps and give it a five star.", "time": 1601906180}, {"author_name": "Diana Sofia Lira Rodriguez", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101157136842426890348/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh5_j2Bg-NchKTsUU1yTYGQVqSRC6s6P8cy3OuU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Vegan empanadas have no flavor.
