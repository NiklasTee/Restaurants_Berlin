I had been traveling on my own for the first time as an adult to Germany to meet with my 89 year old Grandmother, along with my Auntie, and a few Cousin\u2019s. It was the first time I would see my family in over 10 years! My family were traveling from America to Europe for a couple weeks, so I jumped at the chance of being able to meet up with them while on their travels . I arrived first into Berlin, I found the hotel my family would be staying at and had a few hours to spare while waiting on their arrival. I decided to explore some and walked a few blocks from where the hotel was and came across this little restaurant which had outside sitting area, I thought it looked peaceful and inviting. I took a seat outside and very quickly out came a lady to greet me. Unfortunately I only speak English and thought it mite be a bit of a challenge to order something, but was pleasantly surprised that the lady spoke good English. She was very polite, friendly, accommodating, with wonderful service. While sitting outside enjoying my lunch i realized the hotel was on the same street as the restaurant I was dining at and could see it from where I was sitting lol , so it turned out to be the perfect spot to stop at while waiting for my family. The lady serving me got to talking with me, and I told her of me meeting up with my family whom I haven\u2019t seen in over 10 years, which I was so excited about. The lady offered to charge my mobile phone behind the bar so I could stay connected with my family. The lady was very helpful in giving me directions to the nearest park to visit to pass some time. The lady said I could stay as long as I needed too and wasn\u2019t made to feel I had to rush off.  I spent a couple hours here dining, the food was excellent and it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend others to visit.", "time": 1559943714}, {"author_name": "Valentin Pouget", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102545928620304397128/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dh_NmAUXprA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucm_-oshjux8E3qylTX3nvDTn0PsnA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "Sick stomach", "time": 1594376924}, {"author_name": "Henrik Bo Carlsen", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100347879734127333038/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lJ_3s1TJ4Cw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucnrBrs-EAKQ-rompU69hj8Q6S6g8Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "This is an Italian family managed restaurant with excellent food and a very very friendly atmosphere.
