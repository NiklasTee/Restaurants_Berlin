High quality ingredients, couple of unusual specials, cool branding and a really nice location. I also think their Ayran is top notch. BUT, in my opinion Kebab is not supposed to be the way they serve it here.\n\nI found my Klassik Kebap in a wrap way too small, too mild and all in all just a little boring. When you're out for a kebab you kind of want it to be greasy, right? It should be salty, saucy and so loaded with stuff that it's messy to eat. At least that's what I would expect from a Kebab with \"attitude\".\n\nBerlin has dozens of places that sell you exactly that for half the price. If you're looking for a real Berlin Kebab but perhaps don't want to queue at Mustafa's Gem\u00fcsekebab, then try K'Ups Gem\u00fcsekebab in Prenzlauer Berg, roughly 20 minutes walk from here.
