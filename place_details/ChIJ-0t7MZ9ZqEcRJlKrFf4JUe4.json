the Second Time - What a beautiful place, well decorated, good wine and food right around the corner with easy access to unwind...nearly perfect but sadly not the case.\n\nWe went to enjoy a glass of wine last night. We ordered our drinks but some of us were just not hungry and declined to order a large dinner. We instead asked if we could have a small side dish and it turned into a rude few minutes that made us shake our heads and the evening less enjoyable. The host explained to us that this was a restaurant and that he cant just serve side dishes or - God forbid- have us not order a dinner!!! I was absolutely baffled by his response. On top, he made sure to tell us that if we wanted just a drink we could go else where bc his tables were for dinner guests. I looked around and the place was EMPTY at the time (7pm).\n\nWhen we asked for the bill, we got it right away. We also mentioned when he handed ti to us, that we would like to pay by Credit Card. He looked at us again, sighed and said \"well, you could have told me that when you asked for the bill!!!!\" Again, speechless. Dear Brisgavi owners: you have a wonderful little restaurant here, good wines and we really enjoy the ambiance every time we come here. But could you please teach your host to behave cordially when customers are present?\n\nI am wondering if I should contact the owner of the restaurant to make him aware that this is not how you treat guests that order a glass of wine for 10 Euros and stop by more or less frequently. After all, restaurants like these depend on customers from the neighborhood and word of mouth reviews.", "time": 1579450148}, {"author_name": "Max Meer", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117959745092602333265/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GimoTMfdXSdAPj7pPZxIsUsHH2DadlNm5niUaXI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Nice ambience, good wine.
