Been wanting to visit for a while. The burgers are good but in my opinion absolutely not worth the price. I have no problem paying top dollars for a top meal and would be the ideal target customer here but I would still feel weird paying ~20euros for a vegan burger, potatoes and a drink. Especially not in a self serve place in that area. I would understand if the rent would be super expensive like in other parts of Berlin. Also, i went there at 5:30 at opening time and was the only one there today and found one of the staff members cleaning tables (the one who does delivery) and he completely avoided any eye contact and passed by us many times not a hello or anything and he had a grumpy face all the time we were there. Nothing against him but I only noticed that in response to owners saying they really take care of their staff and the prices justify it. It doesn\u2019t look like the staff is very happy (many other people commented the same).\n\nAgain, burger is quite good I would give that 4 stars but the overall experience is not worth it. Please reconsider the price or at least offer the menu in house + offer tap water (don\u2019t get me started on the \u201cmenu\u201d they offer for delivery, a burger is 9.9 and potato wedges are 3.5 and the combo of both gives you a whopping discount of 0.5e... that\u2019s a 4.5% saving).
