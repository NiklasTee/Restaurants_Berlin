our wedding at the Seelodge, because the setting of the facility directly close to the lake was very beautiful at our first visit. Since the wedding was at the end of June, between very hot days, it was still not as hot due to the large trees. Also, the kids enjoyed the beach side within the public area.\nDuring the preparation and first visit, the staff at the Seelodge was very helpful and gave good tips. Since I had to deal with short term notices regarding the actual guest count, the staff was still very accommodating and was updating the calculated invoice at my request during the wedding preparation.\nDuring the wedding itself, the staff was very focused on getting everything ready as planned, although there has been a wedding the day before, with guests still breakfasting on our day. However, everything was ready and efficiently prepared when our ceremony started at 1pm. The service stayed highly professional during the day and also late at night the drinks were prepared with a ready smile.\nSo all in all, it was a very nice event and I felt in very good and experienced hands.", "time": 1563037340}, {"author_name": "Melanie Metzger", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114666857036855707971/reviews", "language": "en-US", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pZXjHdDH20w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuclNGn-2YWE3btH-c8qsWGvoYIkmiQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "I commissioned Optimahl Catering for a small private celebration at extremely short notice.
