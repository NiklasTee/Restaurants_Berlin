On my first time there I had a free drink coupon, because I was staying at the Hotel. As soon as I gave it to the waiter, he looked to it with a judging face and complained that these free drink coupons are a pain to be added to the system. I ordered my food, which is in fact very good, and it came really fast. When I asked to pay, the waiter did not give me a 20% discount he was supposed to, due to my long stay at the Hotel.\n\nOn the second time, who helped me was a different waiter and fortunately I had zero problems. The food once more was fantastic! Ans this time I did not even have to ask for the discount, the waiter noticed the hotel key on my hand and gave the 20% off without even asking anything.\n\nOn the third time, yesterday evening, I went there for the happy hour. The waiter was the same one who helped me on the first visit. My husband and I ordered two drinks each (due to the 2x1 offer during the happy hour time). When I asked for the check, I showed the key to the waiter and asked for the discount. He apparently ignored it, and also charged the wrong drinks. I realized right after I had payed for them, when I mentioned to the guy that he had charged it wrongly. His reply was: \"why?!\", and gave me the receipt. I showed that the price of one of the drinks was wrong, and he told me that he would talk to his boss. Also, the 20% discount had not be given. The manager arrived and sorted everything out, charging for the correct drinks and also giving the 20% discount. She even told me that I did not need to ask for the discount, showing the key is enough. I then made it clear that I have done so, and the waiter completely ignored it (for the second time, since he has done the same on my first visit).\n\nThe vibe of the restaurant is super nice, as well as the food, but this specific waiter needs to be trained asap. He needs to learn to be more polite to the clients, and also to follow the rules of the house regarding the discount for the long-term stayers of the Hotel.\n\nThe prices are also high when compared to other restaurants in Berlin, but I guess this is justified by the fact that the restaurant is located at the Student Hotel.", "time": 1582570686}, {"author_name": "Matthias Eggers", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102458968092787786723/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KxL21aB9E_0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucnzN-n9glmjj0Y_gOc6G11vIUeqEg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "Love the place.
