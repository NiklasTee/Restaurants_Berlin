As I was looking at the menu he was messing with me, (made a pen mark on my hand, flicked my menu, and winked at me). I didn't take it seriously until I got up to use the restroom alone, and I walked into the restaurant approaching our waiter when he then asked me to take a selfie with him, he pulled out his phone and then groped me and kissed me on the cheek. I pulled myself away and ran down the stairs to the restroom. When I was finished using the restroom he was waiting for me at the top of the stairs. He grabbed my hand and tried directing me somewhere and I pulled my hand away exclaiming, \"no what the heck\" and walked back outside to the table where my family was sitting. Seconds later he brought drinks we ordered outside and said, \"I'm sorry I like the blonde girl\" I felt very uncomfortable and unhappy with my food! When my aunt and uncle talked to the manager the offending waiter insisted on translating to the manager about the incident, we were not taken seriously and given the impression this happens on a daily basis but the manager is only worried his waiter will be hit!
