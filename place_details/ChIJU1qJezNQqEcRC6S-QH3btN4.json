She told me to call my friends. I called them, still not knowing what to ask, and they told me a table number. It turns out that one should know the table number to enter. So, dear gatekeeper lady, please simply tell the costumers that you need to learn about  the table number, rather than lecturing and trying to humiliate them. This would also make your job easier.
