First of all, the staff called us during the afternoon asking for food intolerances or dislikes. We mentioned specifically that we do not like exotic meats like pigeon, veal or rabbit. We took the \u201cgrand viaje\u201d, a 9 course tasting menu and guess what meat we have been served: pigeon! Also noted that 6 out of 9 served had mushrooms! Thankfully we love mushrooms but, honestly, it was a bit too much. The staff was helpful and friendly, but truly working under automated means. They presented the dishes very efficiently, but then we asked: \u201cWhat fish is this?\u201d No answer\u2026\nWell done for the sommelier.
