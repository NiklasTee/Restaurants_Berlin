We liked it so much that we recently booked Mr. Ribisel ourselves at a small family celebration. What can I say? We felt completely at ease. Whether ordering, delivery or collection, it was always very professional. In addition, the contact was very human and personal. Simply pleasant.\nAnd now to the most important thing, the food. Simply delicious and visually appealing. The guests were also enthusiastic. Whether the lemon chicken on a skewer, the zucchini rolls with goat cream cheese, the patties with marjoram and fig mustard or the raspberry tiramisu for dessert ... we left nothing. :)\n\nMany thanks to the whole team!", "time": 1599323523}, {"author_name": "Burning Pen", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109674982292675156063/reviews", "language": "en-US", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgSu_VoblDk4B2uy-ePpPXvarrIwL71HheU6i_BkA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "9 months ago", "text": "I am working with Jay and Jaroslav from Ribisel Catering on new website texts and content.
